The goal was to develop a chat room that could protect the users messages by using some cryptographic algorithm.

As a further experiment, once the chat was ready, the teacher asked us to simulate hacker attacks on it. As our simple chat was secure against message interception decryption attacks, we did a script for a DoS attack and for a server hijacking attack.
